what is diff between require and import ?
 
require and import are both used for including modules in JavaScript, 
but they belong to different module systems. require is part of the 
CommonJS module system, primarily used in Node.js, and is executed at
runtime, allowing for conditional loading of modules. Its syntax is 
straightforward and uses module.exports or exports for exporting 
modules. In contrast, import is part of the ES6 module system, 
which is the modern standard for both browser and Node.js 
environments. import statements are executed at compile time, 
cannot be conditionally loaded in the same way as require, and 
support various import styles like named imports and default imports. 
Modules are exported using export and export default. While require 
is still used in older Node.js projects, import is preferred in modern 
development due to better performance, static analysis, and native 
browser support.
